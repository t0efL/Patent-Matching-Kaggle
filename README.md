# Patent-Matching-Kaggle
The solution and code for [U.S. Patent Phrase to Phrase Matching](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching)  competition.   

## CV strategy
StratifiedGroupKFold (stratified by score, grouped by anchor), 5 folds.

## Pre-processing
We used the following input pattern for training our models:  
`anchor + " [s] " + target + " [s] " + context (decoded)`
